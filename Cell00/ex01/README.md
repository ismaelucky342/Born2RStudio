## Steps

1. **Open RStudio**: Launch RStudio on your computer.
2. **Create a New Script**: Go to `File -> New File -> R Script` to create a new R script.
3. **Write the Code**: Enter the following code to calculate the sum of two numbers.

```r
# Define two numbers
number1 <- 10
number2 <- 20

# Calculate the sum
sum <- number1 + number2

# Print the result
print(paste("The sum of", number1, "and", number2, "is", sum))
```
